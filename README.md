## This may be used as the primary backend and is infinitely scabale

## The final backend my be built on top of the smae

### The backend is robust and is capable of interacting with any or all smart contracts and executing methods that the contract incorporates. The transactions may be sent or called to/from the smart contract accordingly.

### The backend houses the necessary dependencies that may be installed while using the same. Also, kindly make use of production node configuration/url since at the moment a custom node was spinned up and the configuration for the same is being used.
